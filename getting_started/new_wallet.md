# Setting up a new wallet

The easiest way to set up a wallet and start *receiving* funds is to use the paper wallet. However, you will need to use either a CLI (Command Line Interface), GUI (Graphic User Interface) or Web Wallet if you want to check your balance or send funds to other people.

## Paper Wallet

Before you get started with a Paperwallet, you should know that you will not be able to spend your funds until you set up an electronic wallet.

To get started with a Paperwallet, you can use the following link: [http://turtlecoin.lol/wallet](http://turtlecoin.lol/wallet) and follow the instructions on the page.

**Remember:** Do NOT give your 'Spend Key' and 'View Key' to anybody.
