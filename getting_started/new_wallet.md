# Setting up a new wallet

The easiest way to set up a wallet and start *receiving* funds is to use the paper wallet. However, you will need to use either a CLI (Command Line Interface), GUI (Graphic User Interface) or Web Wallet if you want to check your balance or send funds to other people.

## Paper Wallet

**Before you get started:** The main purpose of a Paperwallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds. You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up an electronic wallet.

To get started with a Paperwallet, you can use this link: [http://turtlecoin.lol/wallet](http://turtlecoin.lol/wallet) and follow the instructions on the page. Alternatively, if you want to create your wallet while you are offline, you can download the wallet generator [here](https://github.com/turtlecoin/paper-turtle).

You should print this wallet and keep your keys in a safe place, until you are ready to import them into a electronic wallet.

**Remember:** DO NOT give your 'Spend Key' and 'View Key' to anybody.

## Simple Wallet (A.K.A. CLI Wallet)

Before you get started with Simple Wallet, you should know that it is essentially a DOS program. You have to type the commands into the DOS window, you cannot use your mouse. (Currently, as of 8th of April 2018, this is the most stable wallet) 

This is what Simplewallet looks like:
