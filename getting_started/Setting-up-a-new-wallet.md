# Setting Up a New Wallet

The easiest way to set up a wallet and start *receiving* funds is to use the paper wallet. 
However, you will need to use either a CLI (Command Line Interface), GUI (Graphical User Interface) or Web Wallet if you want to check your balance or send funds to other people.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paperwallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds. 

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

To set up a paper wallet, simply follow [this guide](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/wiki/Setting-up-a-paper-wallet).

## Simple Wallet (A.K.A. CLI Wallet)

Before you get started with Simple Wallet, you should know that it is essentially a DOS program. You have to type the commands into the DOS window, you cannot use your mouse. (Currently, as of 8th of April 2018, this is the most stable wallet) 

This is what the Simplewallet looks like:
