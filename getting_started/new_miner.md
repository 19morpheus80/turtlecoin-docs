## How to mine TurtleCoin?

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most anti-viruses will detect the programs below as unsafe. It is **likely** you will need to add exeptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly. 

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

There are currently two miners (programs) which you can use to start mining TurtleCoin:

### 1. [XMR-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)

Xmr-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.

Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wiki/wiki/Mining) to start mining TurtleCoin with xmr-stak.

You can download xmr-stak **[here](https://github.com/brandonlehmann/xmr-stak/tree/add_turtlecoin/builds)**.

### 2. [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

XMRig is a little bit different to xmr-stak, you need to dowload a cpu and gpu miner separately and run two sepparate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU. You can download them here:

1. Download CPU mining xmrig **[here](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)**.
