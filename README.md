## About
This reposity is the **official** home of all TurtleCoin documentation and should be regarded *single source of truth* for all 'official' or officially supported TurtleCoin projects. Because of the distributed, open, community-driven nature of our development teams, we believe the easiest approach to managing our documentation is to organize all of it in this central repository. This helps to avoid duplication and inconsistency and relieves contributors from having to track down and edit multiple documents in multiple places.  
The community makes a best-effort to keep documentation accurate and up-to-date, but please be aware that it may not always reflect reality - code changes may be released before documentation is updated.

## Contributing

Changes, edits, and other contributions to the TurtleCoin documentation can be submitted as a Github Pull Request to this repository, or as a Github Issue on this repo's Issues page.  
Please be granular and make a single commit per change/set of related changes (or file an Issue for each change if not directly submitting PR's). This will make reviewing changes easier and increase the speed and efficiency of getting your changes merged in.
