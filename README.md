# turtledocs

This is the repo where I'm building the new frontend of the wiki, using Mkdocs. The theme is Material.

Deployed with Netlify, check it out!

https://turtlewiki.netlify.com/

## Merging It

`git remote add turtle https://github.com/sajo811/turtledocs.git`

`git fetch turtle master`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "new wiki frontend"`

`git push`

Then someone with write access to turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wiki repo set up netlify acc to auto build from master branch, I can help if needed
