# How to use trtlbot++


## Registering your wallet

Go to #wallets and type `.register <walletaddress>`. 
For example, you would type- `.register TRTLv3pFrFm2yk4cYNtKf5fxV1b594tNrZfEV2CYWJsTSqr9BWoWMrUNpQaeD9StrzQrxpRQKPCdd1FfvT6D6dAg4pY6iB7sqsG`

## Depositing Turtle

After your wallet address has been registered, PM `trtlbot++` with `.deposit`. 

### CLI Wallet

- Copy/paste the command he gives you into the CLI Wallet. 
- Replace `<amount>` with however much you want to send and press enter.

For example, if I PM the bot `.deposit` and get back this-

```transfer 3 TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5 <amount> -p ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e```

Then I will replace `<amount>` with how much I want to send to trtlbot++, let's say 100. So the command I enter is-

```transfer 3 TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5 100 -p ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e```

Then press enter to send your transaction.

### GUI Wallet

- Copy the part from `3` to `<amount>` and enter that as the wallet address. 
- Then, copy the part after `-p` and enter that as the payment address. 
- In amount, mention how much you want to send and set the mixin as 3 and press send.

For example, if I PM the bot `.deposit` and get back this-

```transfer 3 TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5 <amount> -p ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e```

Then I will copy the part from `3 to `<amount>`; that is, `TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5` and enter that as the address.

Then I'll copy the part after `-p`; that is, `ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e` and enter that as the Payment ID.

***PLEASE ENTER YOUR OWN VALUES WHICH THE BOT SENDS YOU!***

#### Expected Results

When the bot recieves the payment, it will send you a PM letting you know. Now you can tip people! 

## Tipping People
To tip someone, type `.tip <amount> <@person>`. 

`<amount>` is how much you will tip the person. 
`<@person>` is whom you'll tip it to.

For example, `.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588` will tip user called "RockSteady" ` 1 TRTL.

### Tipping with Emojis

Reacting with the emoji :almost100: on someone's message will tip them 99 TRTL.

If someone has tipped someone, then reacting with :tip: on the message on which they tipped(`.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588`) will send the recipient (in this case, RockSteady) with the same amount he was originally tipped (in this case, 1). So the recipient (RockSteady) gets 2 TRTL.

#### Information which is nice to know

The minimum you can send is 0.11 TRTL. The bot will take an extra 0.1 TRTL on top of what you tipped to account for fees. So if you tipped 1 TRTL,  1.1 TRTL will be pulled from you account so that the full 1 TRTL reaches the recipient

If you try to tip someone who isn't registered, the bot will react with :sos: and PM him with instructions on how to register. Or you could link him to this guide :)

That's it! Enjoy tipping and getting tipped :)

## Security of trtlbot++'s wallet

trtlbot++ was created and is owned by madk. When he was asked about the security of trtlbot++'s wallet, he said-

"the wallet is pretty secure. All ports are closed except 80, whatever minecraft is and my SSH port. The SSH has no root login and only two valid keys. One of the keys is for an account that has no permissions to go anywhere but one folder (I may revoke this key). There are other security features but I don't want to reveal any possible attack surfaces by accident."

and follows up with-

"And if the wallet gets hacked I will refund people's coins."

and ends it with-

"I'm not gonna up and run with the tipjar like the doge tipbot guy either :)"

So rest assured, as trtlbot++'s wallet is extremely secure, and in the rare occasion that anything *does* happen, you can relax knowing that you'll get it back :)


*Sadly, trying to tip "Roles" (like `@dev-turtle`, `@everyone`, `@here` etc) and expecting the bot to automatically tip everyone with that said role won't work, as it has not been programmed to do so :(*
