# Welcome to TurtleCoin!
### This guide will get you started using TurtleCoin.
Windows 10 (also 7 and 8)

1. First, let's install Turtlecoin, you can skip this if you've already done it!
Download this latest release of TurtleCoin. https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/releases/latest

2. Make a folder called TurtleCoin on your Desktop, and unzip the TurtleCoin-v0.3.0-windows.zip file into the new folder.

3. In the TurtleCoin folder on your desktop, double click the TurtleCoind.exe file to start syncing your blockchain. Don't worry if you don't know what that means, but it lets our wallet talk to the network, so leave it running!

4. You should be syncing and seeing yellow and white text. When you see green text, you are done syncing, it should take around 1-2 hours.

5. run simplewallet.exe. If you see an error that says you can't connect to daemon, that means you closed the TurtleCoind.exe window, or it means you're not done syncing.

6. To make a new wallet, press [G] for Generate Wallet, and give your wallet a name and password.

8. You're done! **Copy your spend key and view key and email them to yourself** so that you can restore your wallet if it breaks or if you lose it!!!

Go to http://chat.turtlecoin.lol and post your wallet address in #wallets and we will get you started with some TRTL to kick the tires a little bit :)
