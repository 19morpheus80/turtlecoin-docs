Go to #wallets and type `.register <walletaddress>`. 
After your wallet address has been registered, PM `trtlbot++` with `.deposit`. He will give you a command to copy/paste into the CLI Wallet. Do that, and replace `<amount>` with however much you want to send and press enter.

If you use the GUI wallet,  copy the part from `3` to `<amount>` and enter that as the wallet address. Then copy the part after `-p` and enter that as the payment address. In amount, mention how much you want to send and set the mixin as 3 and press send.

For example, if I PM the the bot `.deposit` and get back this-

```transfer 3 TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5 <amount> -p ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e```

Then I will copy the part from `3 to `<amount>`; that is, `TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5` and enter that as the address.
Then I'll copy the part after `-p`; that is, `ac8889dfb7c93471a9a43c287f3fa40854b64454e62eb0006b13e510e6ad8a8e` and enter that as the Payment ID.

***PLEASE ENTER YOUR OWN VALUES WHICH THE BOT SENDS YOU!***

When the bot recieves the payment, it will send you a PM letting you know. Now you can tip people! 
To tip someone, type `.tip <amount> <@person>`. `<amount>` is how much you will tip the person. `<@person>` is whom you'll tip it to.

For example, `.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588` will the user called "RockSteady" ` 1 TRTL.

Reacting with the emoji :almost100: on someone's message will tip them 99 TRTL.

If someone has tipped someone, then reacting with :tip:  on the message on which they tipped(`.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588`) will send the recipient (in this case, RockSteady) with the same amount he was originally tipped (in this case, 1). So the recipient (RockSteady) gets 2 TRTL.

The minimum you can send is 0.11 TRTL. The bot will take an extra 0.1 TRTL on top of what you tipped to account for fees. So if you tipped 1 TRTL,  1.1 TRTL will be pulled from you account so that the full 1 TRTL reaches the recipient

If you try to tip someone who isn't registered, the bot will react with :sos: and PM him with instructions on how to register. Or you could link him to this guide :)

That's it! Enjoy tipping and getting tipped :)

Sadly, trying to tip "Roles" (like `@dev-turtle`, `@everyone`, `@here` etc) and expecting the bot to automatically tip everyone with that said role won't work, as it has not been programmed to do so :(*
