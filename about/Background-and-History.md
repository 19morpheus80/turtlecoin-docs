# What is TurtleCoin?

TurtleCoin is a fast, easy and private cryptocurrency which allows you to send money to friends and businesses.

One of TurtleCoin main goals is to make things as simple and as accessible as possible for everyday people, creating a cryptocurrency which is inviting, fun and friendly.

TurtleCoin has the same privacy features you'll find in Monero and Aeon. Every transaction is private unless you choose to make it public.

## How and why was it created?

TurtleCoin was created in December 2017 by RockSteady.

It was born from the idea that there are too many projects out there, which despite having no real product are bringing tons of funding. 

Instead, TurtleCoin's goal is to create a fun project which is easy to use and then let it grow on its own. We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself.

## How we started it

One chilly December night, RockSteady and Bebop were having a beer too many while discussing the madness around fake, flimsy ICOs with no product. Bebop surmised that it just wouldn't be possible to put out a real project now days without a serious team, doing serious marketing, and bringing in serious funding.

RockSteady leaned in closely, stroked his beard intently, and had only one response..

"Hold my beer."

That night, December 9th, 2017, TurtleCoin was born.
