# Our background

Most TurtleCoin Contributors have thick, luscious beards. FACT.

This gives us +10xp Chin Stroke abilities, and enhances our patience and diagnostic skills. 

The truth is, most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.

# How we started it

One chilly December night, RockSteady and Bebop were having a beer too many while discussing the madness around fake, flimsy ICOs with no product. Bebop surmised that it just wouldn't be possible to put out a real project now days without a serious team, doing serious marketing, and bringing in serious funding.

RockSteady leaned in closely, stroked his beard intently, and had only one response..

"Hold my beer."

That night, December 9th, 2017, TurtleCoin was born.

# Why?

Too many projects are bringing in too much funding despite most having no damn product. We figured, "why not do the whole thing in reverse? Start with a fun project, make it as simple and accessible as possible, and let it grow on its own."
We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself. If you think we're wrong, we're happy to talk about it.
