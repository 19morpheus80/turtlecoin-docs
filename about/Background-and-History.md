# What is TurtleCoin?

TurtleCoin is a fast, easy and private cryptocurrency which allows you to send money to friends and businesses.

One of TurtleCoin's main goals is to make things as simple and as accessible as possible for everyday people, creating a cryptocurrency which is inviting, fun and friendly.

TurtleCoin's code is forked from the Bytecoin code, and it has majorly the same privacy features you'll find in Monero and Aeon. Every transaction is private unless you choose to make it public.

Some of the main features of TurtleCoin include:

* On-chain privacy
* Only two decimal places
* Fast transactions
* User-centric developers

## How and Why was it Created?

TurtleCoin was created in December 2017 by RockSteady and Bebop.

It was born from the idea that there were too many projects out there, which despite having no real product, were bringing in tons of funding. 

TurtleCoin decided to do it the opposite way.
It's goal is to create a fun project which is easy to use and then let it grow on its own. 
We have a strong belief in our no-funding strategy; if we make a cool product, the value will create itself.

TurtleCoin was created with **No** Pre-Mine, **No** ICO, and **No** Shenanigans.

## Our Background

Most of us are full-time developers on other projects, and this is our way to give back to the community with something fun.

We also have a wide range of people in the community, people from all walks of life that contribute to the community one way or another. Our community and dev team are growing by the week and this is what makes the TurtleCoin community so great!
