We're working on a guide.\n\n\nQ: I've started mining, how can I view my stats?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Visit your pool's homepage. There should be a spot for you to put in your TRTL address, and you can then view your hashrate, pending balance, payouts, and more.\n\n\nQ: Why is the hashrate on the pool website different to what is shown in my miner?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: The values will always be slightly different as it is an estimate, but if there is a large difference, it is likely you have just started mining. \n\n\nYour hashrate is calculated over time, and so it will slowly go up to the correct level.\n\n\nQ: I've been mining for a while, but my pending balance hasn't gone up?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: On your pool website, check the time that the last block was found on your pool, and the average time to find a block. \n\n\nYour stats will only update when your pool finds a block and it matures, so if your pool doesn't find blocks very often, you will have slower updating stats.\n\n\nQ: I've been mining, but the balance in my wallet hasn't gone up?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: To save money on fees, the pools send payouts in chunks. \nCheck your pool website for your pending balance\n.\n\n\nQ: I got banned from my mining pool. Why?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: If you submit lots of invalid shares, a pool might ban you. Possible reasons for invalid shares can be \n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour hardware getting overworked, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh ping to the pool, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nor your difficulty being set too low. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry lowering any overclocks, choosing a pool closer to you or setting a higher difficulty port. \n\n\nYou should get unbanned after approximately 20 minutes. This is a good time to setup some backup pools!\n\n\nQ: Should I set up multiple pools?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Yes, in case you get banned, or a pool goes down for some time, you can keep mining. A good amount to have would be at least three.\n\n\nQ: Where can I find a list of pools?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: \nHere\n is a list. It also has other nifty stats like the pool's fee, minimum payout and server location.\n\n\nQ: What does \"pool weight\" mean in XMR-Stak?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Pool weight determines what order pools are used in case another is unavailable. \n\n\nHigher weighted pools are used first. \n\n\nIf all pools are the same weight, they will be used in the top to bottom order that they are listed in the \nconfig.txt\n file.\n\n\nQ: What pool should I choose?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: There are a few factors to consider when choosing a pool. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne is your ping, you can find this out by pinging the server in a command prompt by typing \nping address.com\n, where \naddress.com\n is the pool address. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother is the hashrate of the pool. If you go on the pool's website, you can see how often they find blocks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the pool takes a long time to find a block, your stats will take a long time to update. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, the minimum payouts can be significant if you're a small miner. \n\n\n\n\nThis is the amount you need to mine before you get paid. Most pools will list this under the \"Payments\" tab.\n\n\nYou can check \nthis list\n of pools. It specifies each pool's minimum payout as well as server location.\n\n\nQ: How many hashes per second is good for my hardware?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: \nhttp://monerobenchmarks.info/\n is a good source for this. You can look up your \nCPU\n and \nGPU\n.\n\n\nQ: I can't get the miner working, is there an easier way to mine?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: \nYou can try the web miner \nhere\n. You will get a lower hashrate than native mining, and it doesn't have GPU support, however it's very easy to setup. Thanks to @Mongboy for creating this.\n \n\n\nWeb miner currently isn't working. You can hop onto the \nDiscord\n if you're having issues and we'll help you out.\n\n\nQ: What is the miner executable / why isn't it working?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This is a solo miner, which is CPU only. This means to gain any TRTL, you have to find a block by yourself, which unless you have many powerful CPUs, is very unlikely. \n  We strongly recommend using a pool, and a miner such as xmr-stak or xmrig. \n  Nevertheless, if you want to try it out, open a command prompt in the same directory, and run \n\n\nminer.exe --address TRTL...\n\n\n\n\nreplacing \nTRTL...\n with your full TRTL address. \n\n\nYou need to have \nTurtleCoind.exe\n open and synced to use this miner, unlike conventional miners, where the pool hosts the daemon.\n\n\nQ: Is there a calculator to see how much TRTL I'll mine per day?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Your pool's homepage should have one - enter your hashrate and it'll give an estimate of how much TRTL you'll mine per day.\n\n\nxmr-stak issues\n\u00b6\n\n\nQ: How do I view my hashrate in xmr-stak?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Press \nh\n in the xmr-stak window.\n\n\nQ: My PC is laggy when I'm mining in xmr-stak. Can I fix this?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This could be caused by multiple issues:\n  * If you're using a Nvidia card, open up \nnvidia.txt\n, in the same directory as \nxmr-stak.exe\n. Try setting \nbfactor\n to \n8\n and \nbsleep\n to \n100\n, and then reload your miner after saving the file. \n    If it's still laggy, try increasing both values slightly. This will cause you to get less hashes per second, but can let you use your PC more effectively. You can try tweaking the value to increase your hashrate. \n    Some people also achieve success by lowering the thread count.\n  * If you're using an AMD card, lower the value of \nintensity\n in \namd.txt\n.\n  * If you're using just a CPU, you can delete the cores being used from \ncpu.txt\n.\n\n\nQ: How can I use just my GPU/CPU to mine in xmr-stak?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: If you're using XMR-Stak, you can start the miner with a certain command. Check \nthis out\n for more info.\n\n\nQ: My xmr-stak is crashing on startup, with an error about CUDA. What am I doing wrong?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: If you are using a Nvidia card, try opening \nnvidia.txt\n in the same directory as \nxmr-stak.exe\n, and lowering the value of \nthreads\n until it stops crashing.\n\n\nQ: I get a socket error when connecting to a pool in xmr-stak. What am I doing wrong?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Generally, this is due to an incorrectly configured config. In the directory where \nxmr-stak.exe\n is, there should be a file called \nconfig.txt\n. Open this up, and check that it looks similar to this:\n\n\n```\n{\"pool_address\" : \"eu.turtlepool.space:3333\",\n \"wallet_address\" : \"TRTLv2Fyavy8CXG8BPEbNeCHFZ1fuDCYCZ3vW5H5LXN4K2M2MHUpTENip9bbavpHvvPwb4NDkBWrNgURAd5DB38FHXWZyoBh4wW\",\n \"pool_password\" : \"x\",\n \"use_nicehash\" : false,\n \"use_tls\" : false,\n \"tls_fingerprint\" : \"\",\n \"pool_weight\" : 10 },\n\n ```\n\n\n\n\n\nYour wallet address is the address starting with \nTRTL\n, not your wallet filename. \n  This error can also occur if the pool is having issues - try another pool and see if the error continues. \n\n\nSome users have experienced issues with their firewall or antivirus as well however, so perhaps try disabling these if you are experiencing this issue.\n\n\nQ: Can I lower the 2% fee taken by xmr-stak?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This is possible, however please note that these devs are independent from the TurtleCoin project and are doing some great work, so I would suggest leaving it as is. \n  If you do wish to change/remove the dev fee, you will have to compile xmr-stak yourself, they have instructions to do this on their \nGitHub\n, or you can check out the \nLinux guide\n\n  Once you have downloaded the code, you need to change the file \ndonate-level.hpp\n in the \nxmr-stak/xmr-stak/\n folder.\n\n\nQ: I'm getting an error in xmr-stak: \nMEMORY ALLOC FAILED: VirtualAlloc failed. Reboot might help\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This is nothing to worry about, and is because xmr-stak failed to set up largepages. \n\n\nThis can slightly raise your hash rate, and xmr-stak attempts to set it up, but it needs a reboot to apply.\n\n\nQ: I'm missing the file \nvcruntime140.dll\n.

T\n  This can be fixed by re-syncing the correct blockchain from scratch. See the question below.\n\n\nQ: I'm getting a \"corrupted blockchain\" error like this?\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-May-07 15:52:19.877323 INFO    initializing core\n2018-May-07 15:52:19.908530 INFO    Importing blocks from blockchain storage\n2018-May-07 15:52:19.908530 ERROR   Corrupted blockchain.

What should I do?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: In \nsimplewallet.exe\n, type \nexport_keys\n, and save the view and spend key somewhere safe in case something goes wrong, if you haven't already. \n  Then, close and reopen \nTurtleCoind.exe\n and \nsimplewallet.exe\n. \n  Next, type \nreset\n in \nsimplewallet.exe\n after reopening your wallet file.\n  It should start resetting your wallet, but the progress might not be immediately obvious - wait a while, and it should start counting up the blocks and printing out your transactions as it gets to them.\n\n\nQ: How do I backup my wallet?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: If \nTurtleCoind.exe\n is open and synced, open \nsimplewallet.exe,\n and type \nexport_keys\n. \n  Save the view and spend key somewhere safe, and you can use them to reimport your wallet if you lose it.\n\n\nQ: How do I send TRTL?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You can check \nthis out\n for steps on how to send TRTL to someone.\n\n\nQ: How do I send money to exchanges / use payment ID?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You can check \nthis out\n for steps on how to send TRTL with the payment ID.\n\n\nQ: What is mixin?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Mixin is how many times your transaction is \"mixed\" with others for obfuscation and privacy. Most people suggest a mixin of 3. Larger mixins will take longer to be confirmed unless a higher fee is used. A mixin of 0 can be used to have a public transaction(though it is strongly recommended not to do so).\n\n\nQ: How can I view my balance?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: If \nTurtleCoind.exe\n is fully synced, in \nsimplewallet.exe\n, simply type \nbalance\n.\n\n\nQ: I'm seeing an error like this in TurtleCoind.exe: \n2018-Jan-25 23:18:34.620941 WARNING Transaction 862689940f8860b4410a4eef7be326b05aedc6b14a26e68e503769017ee80359 is not valid. Reason: Transaction uses spent key image\n. Should I worry?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: No, this is due to large transactions getting resubmitted on the network, and will be hidden from users in a later release of the software.\n\n\nQ: I'm seeing an error like this in TurtleCoind.exe: \n2018-Jan-26 01:51:56.920444 INFO [45.50.5.81:24899 INC] Tx verification failed\n. Should I worry?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: No, this is a variable that has not been assigned, and will be hidden from users in a later release of the software.\n\n\nQ: How long does it take to sync TurtleCoind.exe?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Currently it takes around a few hours. This number will increase as more people use TRTL and the blockchain gets larger. If you'd like to speed up the process, check out the question below.\n\n\nQ: Can I speed up the syncing of the blockchain?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You can grab a recent copy of the blockchain and incrementally sync from there. See \nHow to Bootstrap the TurtleCoin Blockchain\n for instructions.\n\n\nQ: Can I skip the syncing?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Yes, you can currently use a public node with simplewallet. The keys stay on your PC, so it's secure. Check \nthis guide\n for more information.\n\n\nQ: What does it mean if my balance is locked?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This is a transfer which hasn't been confirmed by the network yet. It will move into your main balance shortly, generally after 3 minutes.\n\n\nQ: In simplewallet.exe, I get an error \nError: failed to save new wallet: boost::filesystem::unique__path: Keyset as registered is invalid\n. How can I fix it?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: This is caused by some broken Windows crypto keys. In the address bar in Windows Explorer, type \n%AppData%/Microsoft/Crypto/RSA/\n. \n  There should be a folder in there, with a long name, like \nS-1-5-21-1416222650-108526586-4052533318-1000\n. \n  Go into this folder and delete the files in there. Then reboot.\n\n\nGUI Wallet(s)\n\u00b6\n\n\nQ: Are there any GUI wallets?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Yes, there are currently 2 GUI wallets actively in development, along with some mobile wallets too. However, they may not be ready for full use yet, and may not work on your operating system.\n\n\n\n\nXamarin Wallet\n\n\nNest Wallet\n\n\n\n\nTo view a guide on using them, check \nthis\n.\n\n\nQ: I'm using the GUI Xamarin wallet, and when I start it up I get an error: \nCould not load file or assembly Newtonsoft.Json\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You need to download the .zip file from the github, not just the .exe file - \nhttps://github.com/turtlecoin/desktop-xamarin/releases\n, you need all of these files for the GUI to work.\n\n\nQ: I'm using the GUI Xamarin wallet, and it fails to connect to the daemon.\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: There are multiple reasons this can occur. Try opening \nwalletd.log\n and scrolling to the bottom to determine what is occurring.\n  * A wrong password - check \nwalletd.log\n to check if this is occurring. If you are sure your password is correct, this link could be helpful - \nhttps://github.com/turtlecoin/desktop-xamarin/issues/20\n\n  * You have another \nwalletd.exe\n or \nTurtleCoind.exe\n process running. Only one of these can be running at once, and the GUI launches its own. Check Task Manager and close down any of these processes and try again.\n  * \nwalletd\n is importing blocks from the DB, which takes a while and so the GUI thinks it has crashed. Solution here - \nhttps://github.com/turtlecoin/desktop-xamarin/issues/17#issuecomment-366790435\n\n  * If all else fails, if you have your private keys then you can instead import your wallet into SimpleWallet. \n    * If that is not a desirable option, come and ask for help over at \nthe Discord\n\n\nPaper Wallet / Cold Storage?\n\u00b6\n\n\nQ: Wait, What's Cold Storage?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: The term \"Cold Storage\" refers to a wallet that has been created via an offline means. \n\n\nThe preferred way to do this is via a computer than has never ever been connected to the internet, commonly referred to as an air gapped device. \n\n\nWhy is this a thing? If done properly it means it is near impossible for the keys to be secretly intercepted since the data is never viewable by other compute devices. \n\n\nYou see above/elsewhere wallet files are being created via the wallet software, these files might be stored unencrypted, if unencypted then the keys can be read by malicious software and balance's of those wallets transferred. \n\n\nThus to protect against that scenario you could transfer any TRTL balance to one of these cold storage addresses. Please remember to keep secure/secret backups of your keys. If you lose the keys you lose any balance that was transferred to that wallet. \n\n\nQ: Can I make a paper wallet?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Yes, you can view the guide \nhere\n\n\nQ: I made a paper wallet, how do I use it?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You can check out \nthis guide\n for steps on how to import your paper wallet into a wallet of your choice(choose a wallet and import the keys).\n\n\nQ: Can I view the balance of my wallet online?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Due to TurtleCoin being a privacy coin, this is not possible. \n\n\nIt should be possible in the future to allow users to give away just their Private View Key to view transactions, but this hasn't been implemented by anyone so far, and would allow that website to see every transaction that you make.\n\n\nOther\n\u00b6\n\n\nQ: Why does TRTL have such a high amount of tokens/small amount of decimal places?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Read a great post about the justification for it \nhere\n.\n\n\nQ: How can I get some TRTL?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: There are multiple ways to acquire TRTL, for example:\n\n\n\n\nMining - see \nhere\n\n\nBuying - TRTL is currently available on these exchanges: \nTradeOgre\n and \nTradeSatoshi\n\n\nBounties - Bounties for developing TRTL software, spreading the word of TRTL, and many other things are often posted in the #bounties channel on discord. Check the pinned messages for current bounties.\n\n\nTips - People will sometimes tip each other, especially if you make spicy memes in the #memes channel\n\n\nRain - Good active Turtles get rained on, check out what the \nRainBorg\n is to see how to use it.\n\n\nFaucet - Head over to the \nfaucet\n and enter your TRTL address. \n    The amount you can receive is limited(1 TRTL, thrice a day), to share the TRTL for all. Thanks to @madk for creating this.\n\n\n\n\nQ: Are there any light wallets / mobile wallets?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: None are ready for usage right now, but they are being worked on. Check the development channels in Discord to see how people are getting on, and feel free to join in if you're a programmer!\n\n\nQ: What is RainBorg / how does it work?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: There is an in depth, graphical explanation \nhere\n \n\n\nQ: How do I register my wallet on Discord?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: You can check out this guide \nhere\n. \n\n\nQ: Where is the blockchain stored?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: On Windows, it is in \n%AppData%/turtlecoin\n. On Mac and Linux, it is in \n~/.turtlecoin\n.\n\n\nQ: Is there a blockchain explorer?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: Yes, there are currently a few-\n\n\n\n\nhttps://blocks.turtle.link\n\n\nhttps://turtle-coin.com\n\n\nhttps://explorer.trtlpwr.cc\n\n\n\n\nQ: How do I make sure a pool isn't forked?\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can ask someone in the Discord with a coloured name to run \n/forked\n for you, which will return with a list of pools which are possibly forked.\n\n\nQ: I have a question which wasn't answered here, what should I do?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA: \nJoin the Discord\n, and come to the \n#help\n channel, we'll try and fix any issues.",

The preferred way to do this is via a computer than has never ever been connected to the internet, commonly referred to as an air gapped device.   Why is this a thing? If done properly it means it is near impossible for the keys to be secretly intercepted since the data is never viewable by other compute devices.   You see above/elsewhere wallet files are being created via the wallet software, these files might be stored unencrypted, if unencypted then the keys can be read by malicious software and balance's of those wallets transferred.   Thus to protect against that scenario you could transfer any TRTL balance to one of these cold storage addresses. Please remember to keep secure/secret backups of your keys.

So the recipient (RockSteady) gets 2 TRTL.\n\n\nReacting with \n on a message where in a person was tipping with the emoji \n will \nnot\n tip the original poster of the message 99 TRTL.\nYou \ncan\n react with the emoji \n (again) however, to tip the person 99 TRTL.\n\n\nTipping Multiple People\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe syntax for tipping multiple people is- \n.tip 1 <@person1 @person2>\n\n\nFor example, \n.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588 @bebop#2640\n\n\nThis will tip RockSteady \nand\n bebop 1 TRTL \neach\n (it will not divide the 1 TRTL in between the 2).\n\n\nThe bot will still pull a fee of 0.1 TRTL extra from your balance.\n\n\nThis can be used to tip - so far - an unlimited amount of people, given that you have enough balance.\nThe bot will PM you after it has sent the payments to everyone, letting you know the TX Hash, your updated balance, and how many people it sent it to, along with the number of \n- successful payments (the recipent had registered their wallet and the payment was successfully sent)\n- unsuccessful payments (the recipent had not registered their wallet and/or the payment was not successfully sent)\n\n\nIf you tip multiple people, some who have registered their wallets and some who haven't, the bot will react with :almost100: and \n for both(only once).\nHowever, it will not let you know whose wallet has not been registered, simply the amount of people it did send it to (so you can deduce the number of people it was not able to send to by subtracting the number of successful payments from the number of people you tipped).\n\n\nSadly, trying to tip \"Roles\" (like \n@dev-turtle\n, \n@everyone\n, \n@here\n etc) and expecting the bot to automatically tip everyone with that said role won't work, as it has not been programmed to do so :(\n\n\nWhere Do These Tips Go?\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen you tip someone, the desired amount plus 0.1 TRTL is pulled from your tipjar wallet balance and sent to the recipient's registered wallet (if he has not registered a wallet, he cannot receive tips).\n\n\nWhen you get tipped, the sender sends the desired amount plus 0.1 TRTL, pulled from his tipjar wallet balance, directly to your registered wallet (if you haven't registered a wallet, you can't receive tips).\nIt also reacts to the message on which the person was tipped (\n.tip 1 @RockSteady#7588\n) with \n\n\nIt \ndoes not\n send the TRTL to your tipjar balance. It sends it \ndirectly\n to your \nwallet\n.\nThis is to ensure that more and more TRTL is introduced into the ecosystem, rather than the same TRTL being circulated around.\n\n\n\n\nIf you try to tip someone who isn't registered, the bot will react with \n and PM him with instructions on how to register their wallet and tip. \n\n\n\n\nSecurity of trtlbot++'s tipjar (wallet)\n\u00b6\n\n\ntrtlbot++ was created and is owned by \n@krruzic\n(@madk#1044  in the chat). When he was asked about the security of trtlbot++'s wallet, he said-\n\n\n\"the wallet is pretty secure. All ports are closed except 80, whatever minecraft is and my SSH port.

Give them all a weight of  10  if you're tired of reading, or if you want the best experience, give the pools nearest to you a higher number, and the ones further from you a lower number.    XMR-Stak will prioritize the highest weight pool, and fall back to the others if it cannot connect.  If they are all given the same weight, it will connect to them in order of how they are listed, form top to bottom, in the configuration file.  If you are on Windows \u215e, it will ask for administrator permission again. Click  Yes  to grant it permission.  If you are on Windows 10, it will not ask for it again.   Done! The miner will now start scanning your hardware and will begin mining. Awesome!  XMR-Stak will save your configuration in  config.txt   in the same directory from which it was first run.   Your configuration for pools(algorithm to mine, address, port etc) will be saved in  pools.txt \nThe configuration of the device it mines(CPU/AMD/NVIDIA) will be saved in  cpu.txt ,  amd.txt  or  nvidia.txt , respectively.  Run XMR-Stak again from the same directory to reuse the configuration",
